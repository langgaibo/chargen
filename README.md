# README #

Just a small project to learn python via D&D / Shadowrun dice rollers and character stat generators.

I don't even play these games!

### What is this repository for? ###

* Selfish history record so I can review the moments when I figured something out.
* People might want to see how a completely non-programmer actually learned to code, since it's hard to un-learn coding knowledge and therefore hard to teach it to other non-programmers because you lose perspective.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just run any of the modules via python from within the directory.
* There is no configuration, but the chargen.py module needs the racestats.py module in the same directory, because I pushed a bunch of grunt functions to that supplementary module.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* This is my thing, fork if you want but don't tell me what to do. I'm learning it on my own.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Go fuck yourself
