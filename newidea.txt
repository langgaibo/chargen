From ex38 in tutorial, got idea for chargen:

Return Stats in order "Str, Int" or whatever, as a list (or) as a string.
After the dice roll, I could find a way to assign the dice rolls (which could
print in an "implied" order) to an ordered Stat list... maybe by doing it 
behind the scenes by pulling the key (stat) values from dict, ordering them,
then just printing the two lists in a special function after all that!!!
